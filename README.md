# new-project
This is a template for getting started with a new project. It contains a barebones HTML index file, some build tools, and my [flexbox-mixins](http://github.com/mmcbride1007/flexbox-mixins).

## Getting started
To get started using this project, `cd` into the directory of your choosing and run the following:

```
git clone http://github.com/mmcbride1007/new-project [your-project-directory]
cd [your-project-directory]
npm install && bower install
```

## Using this template
To run this locally, `cd` into your project and run `gulp serve`. This will start a server, compile your code into a dist folder, and watch for changes to the current directory.
